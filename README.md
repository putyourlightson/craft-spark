# Spark Plugin for Craft CMS

### A real-time, template-driven hypermedia framework for Craft CMS.

Spark provides an integration between [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/) and [Datastar](https://data-star.dev), a JavaScript library that combines the core functionality of [Alpine JS](https://alpinejs.dev/) with that of [htmx](https://htmx.org/). It advocates a hypermedia-first approach, meaning that you won’t find history support, JavaScript execution in responses, nor any other “bells and whistles”. This is intentional. By embracing the simplicity of hypermedia, the encapsulation of web components (natively or using [Lit](https://lit.dev/)) and the optimised DOM operations of web browsers, you can build highly performant, hypermedia-driven web apps, without requiring a full-blown JavaScript framework.
